# Respaced - Unity 3D Game

In the Elevated Ants Studio we made a Roguelite Space Shooter called ReSpaced. I fulfilled the role of Game Designer, with the specific role of UI/UX-Design, Level Design and Quality Assurance

## Pitch

A fast-paced first-person shooter where you master gun recoil to leap across platforms, battle various enemies, and upgrade your weapon to escape an overrun space station.
